C++ is a case sensitive language.
; is used to terminate the statement it  is very similar to full stop(.) in english.

Main function is the starting point of the code from where the code execution will start.
    ex: int main(){
        //code will code here.
    }


#include <iostream> through this will till to compiler before compiling that their is a file iostream where their is a function cout() cin()

cout is used for output. cout<<"Hello";  cin>>a; cin for input.

namespace is can say a file in which logic of many function is written. 


Basic code for printing hello world 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World";  // to print hello world;
    return 0; // the main function is integer function so we have to return an integer value without this code will run perfectly but to return zero is good programming practice.
}



endl or "\n" used to break the line and go to next line.


// Boilerplate code 
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main(){
    return 0; // We have to always write this code to run the file successfully
}

Comment are the part of code but it is ignored by the compiler it the time of execution.


Variable as the container used to store data. Ex : a = 20;


Whenever we define the variable we have to define datatype.

Types of datatype : 
int, float, char, bool, double.

int datatype take 4 bytes of place in memory. 1 is a single bit. 8 is equal to 1 Byte. 8 byte is equal to 32 bits data.

int = 4 Bytes.
char = 1 Bytes. Character is first converted into ASCII value then stored in the memory.
float = 3.14F F is used here to tell the compiler that we want to store float value not the double because by default compiler store as double. It also occupy 4 bytes of memory.


Bool datatype is used to initalise the variable as True or False. True is stored as 1 and False is stored as 0 in memory.

double is store when we store long length data. It store the value of 8 bytes of Data in the memory.

int, float, char, bool and double are primitive datatype.


Typecasting : To convert data from one type to another type.

Implicate conversion : To convert from small byte data to big data.
Ex : char to integer 1 Byte data to 1 Byte data to 4 Byte

Explicate Conversion : To convert data from Big to Small. 
Ex to convert double to integer datatype.
Ex 100.99 to (int)100.99 the value will be 100.

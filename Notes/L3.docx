Condition Statements : To include condition we use condition statement.
if is used to check the condition 
if (n>0){ // if condition is true then the rest of the code will run
    cout<<"Positive"<<endl; 
    
    
    //Block of code  To multiple things in code we use {} BLock of code is used to right Statements.
    Statements means what we want to do in this

}

To check multiple condition we use if else if else

if(){
    //code
}
else if(){
    //code
}
else if(){
    //code
}
else if(){
    //code
}
.
.
.
else{
    //code
}

we do not use multiple if to check multiple condition.


Ternary Statement : When we have to check only when condition we can use Ternary Statement.

Syntax : condition ? true condition : false condition

cout<<(n>10 ? "True" : "False");

Loops : To use or do same things again and again we use Loops 

While Loop : While loop is used when we don't know how many time the loop will run in advance.
while(True){ (Condition)
    //Statements
}
For Loop : It should be used when we know what is the start and end condition.

for(start; end; increment/decrement){
    //code
}
